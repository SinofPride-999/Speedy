My Speedy Search App Story
  Yo, so here's the deal, 
  I was a Mac user for so long and got way too used to Spotlight. 
  That instant search? The clean results? Perfect. 
  Then life happened, I had to switch back to Windows, and oh boy...


Windows Search Sucks (Let's Be Real)
  File Explorer search? Basically a loading bar simulator.
  Cortana? More like Cor-tortoise (and now it's dead anyway).
  Start menu search? Decent, but still feels clunky.

I missed just hitting ⌘ + Space, typing a few letters, 
and boom—instantly finding anything. So instead of suffering, 
I thought:
"Fine, I’ll Build It Myself."

6 days later, Speedy was born.

What Makes Speedy Different?
  It Actually Works
    No waiting for indexing to finish.
    No random delays.
    Just spacebar → type → results appear instantly.

  Looks & Feels Like Spotlight (But Better)
    Clean, blurry transparent background.
    Smooth animations.
    Dark/light mode that just works.

  Remembers What You Use Most
    The more you open something, the higher it shows up.
    No weird Bing suggestions or ads (looking at you, Windows).

  Keyboard-First (Like It Should Be)
    Space-bar → Open search.
    Arrows → Navigate.
    Enter → Open.
    Escape → Close.
    No mouse needed (but you can click if you want).


How I Built It
I used:
  - Tauri (Rust + Web tech, so it’s fast and tiny).
  - React (for the smooth UI).
  - SQLite (to store file locations without bloat).

The magic happens in Rust—it scans your files once, 
remembers them, and then searches stupid fast. 
No cloud crap, no telemetry, just your files, 
your search, instantly.

Why This Rocks for Me (And Maybe You)
  No more waiting for Windows search to "think."
  No more digging through folders like it’s 2005.
  Just hit space, type, open. Done.

It’s the app I needed because Windows sure wasn’t giving it to me. 
And now? I don’t miss Mac at all.

Mission accomplished.
